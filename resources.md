While LeetCode isn't focused on creating **views** directly (it usually expects single SQL queries), 
many LeetCode SQL problems mirror the core logic in your tasks, especially aggregation, filtering, grouping, and ordering.

similar **LeetCode SQL questions** that can help you practice the concepts involved.
